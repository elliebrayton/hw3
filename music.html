						<p>Donald Glover’s stage name is Childish Gambino which came from a Wu-Tang Clan name generator. He released his first mixtape was Sick Boi in 2008. His next mixtape, Poindexter, was released on September 19, 2009, the same day Community premiered on NBC. While his brainy, sometimes goofy rapping style was established by these two mixtapes, his next efforts sought to expand his reach and touch on more serious subjects.</p>
						<p>I Am Just a Rapper and I Am Just a Rapper 2 were released in quick succession at the beginning of 2010, followed a couple months later with Culdesac, a mixtape that showed off Glover's soulful singing style. All the while, he was still starring on Community, launching a successful standup comedy career, and making electronic music under the name mcDJ. Up to this point, all his music had been self-released, but that changed when he was signed to Glassnote Records in 2011. His first official album, Camp, was issued that same year. Busy as ever, Glover launched a tour that lasted into 2012, then released another mixtape, Royalty, denoting his new status as a more serious rapper and featuring a range of musicians including Beck, ScHoolboy Q, and Das Racist's Heems.</p>
						<p>He released his second album, Because the Internet. The record featured appearances by Chance the Rapper, Jhené Aiko, and Azealia Banks, and scored Childish Gambino a Top Ten debut chart placement, a gold record, and a nomination for Best Rap Album at the 2015 Grammy Awards. Glover kept up the same determined pace, and in 2015 released a new mixtape, STN MTN (named for Stone Mountain, Georgia, where he grew up), and EP, Kauai, both of which showed him expanding his sound, with the latter featuring more singing than before.</p>
						<p>In late 2016, he began dropping hints about a new album, playing a festival in California where he debuted new songs. The first taste of his new sonic direction arrived with "Me and Your Mama." It was a new sound cooked up by Glover and longtime producer Ludwig Göransson, based on deeply weird late-'60s and early-'70s psychedelic funk and soul like Sly & the Family Stone and Funkadelic. Peaking in the Top Five of the Billboard 200 upon release in late 2017, the critically lauded "Awaken, My Love!" featured Glover forgoing his trademark rap style in favor of stretching his vocal range in a variety of styles. The album's soulful single "Redbone" was also a hit, peaking just outside the Hot 100 and adding Grammy winner to Glover's resumé.</p>
						<p>With the production help of DJ Dahi and the musical skills of Göransson and a small band of collaborators (including Ariana Grande and Kadhja Bonet), Glover spent two years working on 3.15.20, a head-spinning collection of tracks influenced by funk, soul, psychedelia, and the cosmos that's underpinned by a strong message of social justice and Glover's flexible vocal style. After being leaked on the Internet for one night only on March 15th 2020, it was issued for real a week later.</p>
