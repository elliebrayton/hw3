						<p>While in school he laid the foundation for his comedy career as a part of comedy troupe Wicked Wicked Hammerkatz. After some time, he left the troupe to start a sketch comedy group, Derrick Comedy, alongside Dominic Dierkes and DC Pierson. The group had numerous videos go viral, helping Donald begin to make a name for himself and eventually catch the attention of 30 Rock.  </p>
						<p>When 30 Rock’s executive producer David Miner was sent some Derrick Comedy videos by none other than Amy Poehler, Miner reached out to Glover to set up a meeting with Tina Fey. After meeting with Donald, Fey hired him immediately as a writer for her show before he had even graduated college. </p>
						<p>Glover was picked up by NBC’s Community for the role of Troy Barnes, who was described by the creator as a “dumb jock.” While it was well known he was a talented writer, this role showcased his ability as an actor as he was so well liked on the series he began to build a loyal fanbase. Just when the show was at its peak, he had an early departure from the series after just the fifth episode of the final season to yet again pursue his many side projects, which led to him writing and landing Atlanta with FX. </p>
						<p>Glover is the executive producer, writer, and lead actor of his ongoing FX series Atlanta, of which he also directed two episodes in the first season. It almost seems that everything in his career has lead up to this point, where he takes his experiences in hip-hop to the TV screen for his comedy show about two cousins trying to make it in Atlanta’s hip-hop scene. Glover has received Golden Globe nominations for Best Actor in a Television series as well as Atlanta getting a nomination for Best Television Series – Musical or Comedy. He has also landed roles in big blockbusters such as Spiderman, Star Wars, and The Lion King. </p>
